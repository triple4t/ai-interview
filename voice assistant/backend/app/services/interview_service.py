IMPORTANT: This interview consists of EXACTLY 5 questions. Evaluate all 5 Q&A pairs in the order they are presented.

SCORING PRINCIPLE:
Score each answer based on:
- Is the answer CORRECT? (Technical accuracy)
- Does it COMPLETELY address the question? (Completeness)
- Is it well-explained? (Clarity)

SCORE RANGES:
- 90-100: Completely correct, comprehensive, well-explained
- 80-89: Correct with minor gaps or could be more detailed
- 70-79: Mostly correct but missing some important points
- 60-69: Partially correct, some understanding shown
- 50-59: Vague or partially incorrect
- 40-49: Mostly incorrect or very vague
- 30-39: Incorrect with minimal correct information
- 20-29: Very incorrect or doesn't address the question
- 10-19: Almost no correct information
- 0-9: No answer, "I don't know", or completely wrong

CRITICAL: You MUST evaluate each Q&A pair in the exact order provided. Question 1's answer is Answer 1, Question 2's answer is Answer 2, etc.

INTERVIEW DATA:

Full Conversation Context:
{conversation}

For each question, evaluate:
1. Does the answer correctly address what was asked?
2. Is the technical content accurate?
3. Is it complete and well-explained?

CRITICAL RULES FOR QUESTION EXTRACTION:
1. Extract ONLY the actual question text - remove ALL transition phrases, hints, responses, and acknowledgments
2. DO NOT include phrases like:
   - "That's okay, no worries"
   - "That's a good start!"
   - "Let's think about it together"
   - "Of course, no worries"
   - "Let's move on"
   - "Great! Let's move on to the next question"
   - Any acknowledgments or hints before or after the question
3. Extract ONLY the question itself, for example:
   - If the transcript says: "That's okay, no worries. Can you talk about how you would choose a vector database?"
   - Extract ONLY: "Can you talk about how you would choose a vector database?"
4. If a message contains both a hint/response AND a question, extract ONLY the question part
5. Questions are typically sentences ending with "?" or sentences starting with question words (what, how, why, when, where, who, can you, tell me, explain, describe)

CRITICAL RULES FOR ANSWER EXTRACTION:
1. Extract the candidate's actual response to each question
2. If the candidate said "I don't know" or didn't answer, use "No answer provided"
3. If the candidate's answer is in a different message after the question, extract that answer
4. Do NOT include the interviewer's responses or hints in the answer

INTERVIEW STRUCTURE:
- The interview consists of EXACTLY 5 main questions
- Each question should be numbered sequentially (1-5)
- Extract questions in the order they appear in the transcript
- Match each question with the candidate's corresponding answer
